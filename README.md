This Pacman search project was not created by me

TO RUN THIS PROJECT YOU NEED PYTHON VERISON 3.6 OR 3.7 (I ran this with 3.7)

I coded the algorithms:

depthFirstSearch() in search.py

breadthFirstSearch() in search.py

aStarSearch() in search.py


CornersProblem class in searchAgents.py (execept for getCostOfActions())
